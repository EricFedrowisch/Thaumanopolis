1)"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: resource AM2_at.cfg not found."
-Server complains that it can't find AM2_at.cfg file. This is ok. It is a deprecated warning.
2)Mods that add biomes require you to delete config/atg folder so that it can take the new biomes into account.
3)NEI Config settings for the server are stored in world/NEI and are often accidently deleted when a new world is made. Copy and rename 'world_blank' folder to 'world' when making new world to keep the NEI settings.
4)CustomNPCs default enchant ID conflict. Use config in Notes folder or set ID range to start at 200.
5)Dimensional Doors has as biome ID conflict. Use config in 'Notes' folder.
6)Past problems with 'base damage' setting for Grimoire of Gaia mobs. Setting to false.
