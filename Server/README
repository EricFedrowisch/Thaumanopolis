BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM YOU MUST CONFIGURE THE CONFIG FILE.

config contents explained:

*ip - The IP of your server. Use LOCAL IP (like 192.168.1.X) if you are hosting the server on the same machine!
*port - The port of your server
*interval - The interval in seconds of server status polls
*closecmd - The command to execute to close the server
*opencmd - The command to execute to open the server

===WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS

if you're running the .exe version of minecraft server:
closecmd=taskkill /f /fi "WINDOWTITLE eq Minecraft server" /im javaw.exe
opencmd=cmd.exe /c start C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Server\\Minecraft_Server.exe

if you're running the .jar version of minecraft server: (lets say you run it with run.bat)
closecmd=taskkill /f /fi "WINDOWTITLE ne MineStart" /im cmd.exe
opencmd=cmd.exe /c start C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Server\\run.bat

Then simply run your server, and start MineStart. If your server goes to an unjoinable state for any reason,
MineStart will automatically restart it for you every time.

===LINUX INSTRUCTIONS
(designed for console version of linux)

First, you should move MineStart.jar and the config file to the folder
that contains your minecraft server jar file.

closecmd=pkill -f MINECRAFTMS
opencmd=screen -d -m -S MINECRAFTMS java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui

Then, cd to the server folder if you haven't already, make sure your server is off, and execute:
screen -d -m -S MINESTART java -Xmx124M -Xms124M -jar MineStart.jar

Then wait. After interval amount of seconds MineStart will detect your server offline and start it using the opencmd.
MineStart will restart your server automatically if it goes to an unjoinable state.

If you want to close the server, first close MineStart by either pkill -f MINESTART or ps aux and kill using PID.



THESE COMMANDS ARE JUST EXAMPLES. YOU CAN USE WHATEVER YOU WANT.
